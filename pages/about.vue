        My frontend expertise revolves around building high-performance,
        user-friendly interfaces using modern technologies like
        <em>Vue.js</em> and <em>Nuxt.js</em>. I leverage <em>TypeScript</em> for
        type safety and tools like <em>Vite</em> for optimized build processes.
        My approach emphasizes clean, responsive design using
        <em>Tailwind CSS</em> and <em>SCSS</em>, with a strong focus on
        component-based development. By utilizing <em>Vuex</em>, <em>Pinia</em>,
        and <em>VueUse</em>, I ensure that my applications are not only visually
        appealing but also robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

      <p class="content">
        For the backend of this project, I opted for <em>NestJS</em> because,
        while some might consider it overkill for smaller projects, I recognize
        that backend development isn't my strongest area. NestJS, with its
        highly opinionated structure and design patterns, provides a robust
        foundation that helps me avoid common pitfalls. Though it may have a
        steeper learning curve and could be seen as time-consuming, I believe
        that starting with a less structured framework can lead to issues down
        the road. I also believe that by working with highly strcutured
        frameworks is a great opportunity to understand further their design
        decisions, why they exist and how they can help to build better
        software. <br /><br />

        To further ensure consistency and ease of setup, I decided to use
        <em>Docker</em>, particularly for managing <em>MySQL</em>, which was
        chosen to align with specific job requirements.
        <em>Docker</em> simplifies the process of setting up the
        <em>MySQL</em> database, ensuring that my development environment is
        consistent, reliable, and easy to manage.
